# Contributing
When contributing either take an [issue listed](https://github.com/mmikaeleriksson/workTime/issues) or create a new issue that you think should be added.

## Library usage
This project uses Bootstrap and some other github projects as submodules.
When making changes try to look into those libraries and see if something useful can be used from there.

## Pull Request
- Submit a pull request and mention which issue number it solves.
- Add yourself to the contributors in [README.md](https://github.com/mmikaeleriksson/workTime/blob/master/README.md)

Pull requests might not be merged directly during [#hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) so that more people have time to give the problem a try for themselves.
